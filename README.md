## Overview  
A **machine learning-driven statistical arbitrage system** that identifies **cointegrated asset pairs** and executes trades using **dual-pipeline models with meta-labelling** for enhanced signal accuracy.  
The strategy is **market-neutral**, uses **advanced risk management**, and is designed for **scalable deployment**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd statistical-arbitrage

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the strategy
python StatArb.py
```

## Architecture & Methodology
**Pairs Selection** <br />
DBSCAN & OPTICS clustering to identify cointegrated asset pairs

Statistical testing for cointegration relationships

Dynamic pair correlation analysis

**Feature Engineering & Selection** <br />
Multicollinearity testing using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

XGBoost feature importance ranking for optimal input selection

Rolling window feature calculations for time-series stability

**Dual-Pipeline ML Models** <br />

**Risk Management & Position Sizing** <br />
Custom Kelly Criterion: Volatility-adjusted position sizing based on market conditions

Purged K-Fold Cross-Validation to eliminate look-ahead bias

Dynamic stop-loss and take-profit: Adaptive risk controls based on z-score movements

## Modifying Results:

1. Modify the rolling spread calculation in StatArb.
2. Modify the parameters that go into the target labelling. (self.period, self.SR, self.RF). These are found in: Labelling.py, Feature_Importance.py & ML-Models.py.
3. Modify the parameters in Backtest.py. Most are found in init, however, make sure to modify z_score_volatility in the kelly criterion method. 
4. Can modify the kelly weighting (weight_kelly) in the kelly criterion method in Backtest.py 
5. Can also modify the pair selection ML method in PairSelection.py. (DBSCAN or Optics) 
6. Can modify the stop loss and take profit criteria (based on cumualtive return or z_score movement) in Backtest.py. 
7. Can modify the filter for trading in Backtest.py (long_condition & short_condition)
